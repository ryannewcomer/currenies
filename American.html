      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>The</p>
      <p class="red">US</p>
      <p> dollar (USD) became the official currency of the </p>
      <p class="red">United States</p>
      <p> (US) in
        1792, but the dollar actually has
        origins in 16th century Europe. The ‘thaler’, a common name for a Czech coin, became used to describe any
        similar European silver coin – translated into English, it means ‘dollar.’

        The term dollar found its way to the New World during the Spanish colonisation, where the Spanish peso, or
        dollar, was used in Mexico to back paper money.</p><br>
      <p>Over all its highs and lows, the dollar has remained the de facto global currency with over 65% of all dollars
        in circulation being used outside of the US. It is used in 50% of international trade and is included in every
        major forex pair, accounting for 80% of forex trading. </p><br>

      <p>More than a third of countries peg their currency to the dollar. While it is no longer backed by gold, it is
        backed by the largest economy in the world. It is used as the reserve currency of most central banks as a hedge
        against inflation, and in 2017, the banks of Germany, France and the UK held more liabilities in dollars than
        their own currencies.</p>
