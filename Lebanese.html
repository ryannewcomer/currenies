      <h2>History</h2><br>
      <p>Until World War I, the Turkish pound was the currency used in the area. In 1918, after the fall of the Ottoman
        Empire, the Egyptian pound was used. Upon gaining control of Syria and
      <p style="color: red;"> Lebanon</p>, the French replaced the Egyptian
      pound with a new currency for Syria and <p style="color: red;"> Lebanon</p>, the Syrian pound, which was linked to
      the franc at a value of
      LS 1 = 20 F. <p style="color: red;"> Lebanon</p> issued its own coins from 1924 and banknotes from 1950.[citation
      needed] In 1939, the
      Lebanese currency was officially separated from that of Syria, though it was still linked to the French franc
      and remained interchangeable with Syrian money. In 1941, following France's defeat by Nazi Germany, the currency
      was linked instead to sterling at a rate of LL 8.83 = GBP1.00[8] A link to the French franc was restored after
      the war, but was abandoned in 1949.r</p>
